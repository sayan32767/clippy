# Clippy

## Overview

Clippy is a cross-platform application designed to sync clipboard content across multiple devices seamlessly. The app is available on Windows, Android, and Web. It leverages Firebase for real-time synchronization and is built using Flutter for the Android and Web versions, while the Windows version uses a webview embedded in a Python application. However as of now, the process is NOT automated, and you need to manually paste the content in a dedicated field in order to sync it across devices.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Synchronize clipboard content across Windows, Android, and Web.
- **Real-time Updates**: Instantaneous clipboard updates using Firebase.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for easy usage.

## Tech Stack
